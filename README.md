# Bookshelf-API

This project is a part of assignments of [Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Back-End untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/261/tutorials/14967). 
In this project, I tried to create Bookshelf API such as adding a book, showing all books, showing detail of a book, changing the data of a book, and deleting a book.
